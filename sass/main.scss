/*
Note: 
    The reason we import each of the SASS file is because we want to separate them 
        and reuse it where we need to in the application. This file is main file 
        that we import all the files we need.
    This is CSS architecture and the way we construct the folders in a large 
        application. It is better to start right from the beginning.
